This is the bootstrap WAD builder.

Deutex requires an IWAD to build wads and will refuse to build a WAD if
an IWAD is not provided. The script here creates a minimal IWAD file that
contains all the lumps deutex needs: PLAYPAL (the freedoom PLAYPAL),
an empty TEXTURE1 lump and a PNAMES lump with one lump in (deutex needs
PNAMES lumps to have at least one entry)

Because deutex includes all textures from the parent iwad when building
WADs, it is important that the bootstrap wad has as few textures as
possible.
